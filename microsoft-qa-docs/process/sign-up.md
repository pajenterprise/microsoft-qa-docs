## Profile creation guidelines

Note that the field that is used in Microsoft Q&A is your user name. So make sure this field is properly crafted so other users can identify yourself correctly.

- Use one of the following two naming conventions
    1. Your Microsoft alias followed by "-MSFT" to identify yourself as a Microsoft employee. 
    2. Your name followed by "-MSFT" to identify yourself as a Microsoft employee. 
- Remove any numbering that profile adds to your user name.
- If you are a v-, please do not include the name of your company in your user name.
